An event management calendar project involves creating a digital calendar system to manage and track various aspects of events, such as scheduling, venues, participants, tasks, and deadlines. The system can include features like event creation, editing, and deletion; participant management; task assignment and tracking; notifications; and reporting. It aims to streamline the event planning process, improve communication among team members, and ensure timely execution of tasks to make events successful.
